Dear Dheera ‚ù§,

As I sit down to write this letter, I find myself overwhelmed with emotions,
trying to encapsulate the significance of your presence in my life. 
Since childhood, you've been more than just a brother-in-law to me; 
you've been a pillar of support, a confidant, and a true friend.

Our bond created  through shared experiences and cherished memories, 
is something I hold it to my heart. From the playful adventures of our 
youth to the wisdom we've gained through the years, our journey together
has been nothing short of extraordinary.

In a world where relationships often come and go, ours has remained rock solid 
and unwavering. It's a bond built on trust, understanding, and unconditional love.

As your birthday approaches, 
I want to take this opportunity to express just how much you mean to me. 
You've been there for me through thick and thin, offering guidance and support whenever I needed it most. 
Your presence in my life is a gift, one that I cherish more with each passing day.

So here I go, dear Dheera, on your special day, 
may it be filled with love, laughter, and all the joy your heart can hold. 
And as we celebrate another year of your life, 
know that my love for you knows no bounds and that our bond will remain unbreakable, now and forever.
Don't ever think of leaving me behind and I mean it.

Happy birthday Dheera ‚ù§ü´Ç!

With all my love,
Murali.
