Dear Dheera‚ù§,

As I sit down to write this letter, I find myself overwhelmed with emotions, 
trying to encapsulate the significance of your presence in my life. 
Since childhood, you've been more than just a brother-in-law to me; 
you've been a pillar of support, a confidant, and a true friend.

Our bond created through shared experiences and cherished memories is something I hold dear to my heart. 
From the playful adventures of our youth to the wisdom we've gained through the years, 
our journey together has been nothing short of extraordinary.

In a world where relationships often come and go, ours has remained rock solid, and unwavering. 
It's a bond built on trust, understanding, and unconditional love.

So here I am,
wishing you a special day filled with love, laughter, and all the joy your heart can't hold. 
And as we celebrate another year of your life, 
know that my love for you knows no bounds and that our bond will remain unbreakable, now and forever. 
Don't ever think of leaving me behind, and I mean it.

Happy birthday Dheera‚ù§ü´Ç!

With all my love,
Murali.
